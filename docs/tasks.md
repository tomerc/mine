# Binary Tree Project Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Design Improvements
[ ] Refactor BinaryNodeImpl and RedBlackNodeImpl to use generic key types instead of hardcoding Integer
[ ] Create a proper BinaryTree interface and implementation in the binary-tree-api module
[ ] Complete the RedBlackTreeImpl implementation with proper insertion, deletion, and balancing logic
[ ] Fix the isParent() method in BinaryNodeImpl which incorrectly returns true when parent is null (should be renamed to isRoot())
[ ] Add proper Javadoc documentation to all interfaces and classes
[ ] Implement proper equals() and hashCode() methods in RedBlackNodeImpl
[ ] Add toString() method to RedBlackNodeImpl for better debugging
[ ] Consider adding immutable implementations of the node interfaces for thread safety
[ ] Implement tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) in tree implementations
[ ] Add search functionality to tree implementations

## Code Quality Improvements
[ ] Add proper null checks and validation in all implementations
[ ] Implement proper exception handling throughout the codebase
[ ] Add logging using a standard logging framework (SLF4J)
[ ] Remove unused imports and organize imports consistently
[ ] Apply consistent code formatting across the codebase
[ ] Add @Override annotations where methods override or implement interface methods
[ ] Add @Nullable and @NotNull annotations where appropriate
[ ] Fix the duplicate annotations-java5 dependencies in binary-tree-redblack/pom.xml
[ ] Add proper scope (test) to the test-jar dependency in binary-tree-redblack/pom.xml

## Test Coverage Improvements
[ ] Add unit tests for BinaryNodeImpl
[ ] Add comprehensive tests for RedBlackTreeImpl covering all operations and edge cases
[ ] Implement test utilities for creating test trees and verifying tree properties
[ ] Add tests for Red-Black tree properties (root is black, no red node has a red child, etc.)
[ ] Add tests for tree balancing after insertions and deletions
[ ] Add performance tests for large trees
[ ] Replace the empty TestTest class with proper tests
[ ] Add integration tests for complex operations

## Build and Dependency Management
[ ] Update Spring Boot dependencies to a newer version (current: 1.5.10.RELEASE)
[ ] Update TestNG to a newer version (current: 6.8.21)
[ ] Remove unnecessary Spring Boot dependency from binary-tree-api
[ ] Use specific versions for dependencies instead of RELEASE
[ ] Add dependency management for all dependencies in the parent POM
[ ] Configure Maven plugins for code coverage (JaCoCo)
[ ] Add Maven plugins for static code analysis (PMD, FindBugs/SpotBugs)
[ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar
[ ] Add Maven wrapper configuration for consistent builds

## Documentation Improvements
[ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with project description, usage examples, and build instructions
[ ] Add architecture documentation explaining the design decisions
[ ] Document the Red-Black tree implementation details and algorithms
[ ] Add Javadoc comments for all public methods and classes
[ ] Generate and publish Javadoc documentation
[ ] Add diagrams illustrating the class hierarchy and relationships
[ ] Create usage examples for common operations

## Feature Additions
[ ] Implement AVL tree as another balanced binary tree implementation
[ ] Add serialization/deserialization support for trees
[ ] Implement tree visualization utilities
[ ] Add benchmarking tools to compare different tree implementations
[ ] Support for different comparison strategies (custom Comparators)
[ ] Add bulk operations (insertAll, removeAll)
[ ] Implement iterator pattern for tree traversal
[ ] Add stream API support
